# The bot from the future

The bot from the future is inspired by and builds upon [The Thing From The Future](http://situationlab.org/projects/the-thing-from-the-future/) created by Situation Lab. Head over to their site to read the original rules, learn more about the card game and buy a set for yourself. 

The bot uses the four categories/types of card from The Thing From The Future (Arc, Terrain, Object, and Mood) to create a creative prompt for imagining a thing from the future. 

It resides at https://twitter.com/BotFromFuture and is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
